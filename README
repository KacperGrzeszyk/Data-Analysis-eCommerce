Project Description: Sales Data Analysis and Visualization

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis and visualization of a retail sales dataset. The data comes from a public dataset available on the Kaggle platform and contains transaction details such as purchase date, product category, customer gender and age, and total sales amount.

Main goals of the project:
- Investigate the most frequently sold product categories.
- Analyze sales value broken down by product categories.
- Track monthly sales trends.
- Analyze the number of transactions by customer gender and product category.
- Examine the age distribution of customers across different product categories.
- Present monthly sales broken down by product categories.

Technologies and libraries used:
- Python with libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Kaggle API for downloading and extracting data
- Seaborn with a custom dark theme applied to the plots for better readability

Functionality:
- Downloading and loading data from a CSV file.
- Processing dates and creating new helper columns (e.g., month, year).
- Grouping data and summing sales amounts by different dimensions.
- Creating various charts such as bar plots, boxplots, and category/gender breakdowns.
- Applying a custom dark theme to charts for improved aesthetics and clarity.

Visualizations included:
- Most frequently sold products.
- Total sales value by product category.
- Monthly sales amounts.
- Number of transactions by gender and product category.
- Age distribution of customers by product category.
- Monthly sales split by product categories.

Summary:
This project provides insights into customer purchasing behavior and sales trends over time. The analysis can be used to support business decisions such as product promotions and inventory planning.
